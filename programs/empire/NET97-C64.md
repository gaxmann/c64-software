## NET'97 C64 Userport Network (historical reconstruction notes)

This document summarises the reconstructed hardware and software behaviour for a max. 4-node C64 userport network used by “Empire C64”. The original documentation is lost. This document has been reconstructed from memory and looking at the assembler code. 

The software utilises the powerful serial interface of the CIA 6526 in the Commodore 64 and achieves approx. 8 kB/s (#$07 in Timer A). Significantly higher transfer rates were possible with only two C64s. (For comparison: the standard VC1541 transfers at 0.6 kB/s.)   

## Hardware overview

The network is a 4-wire shared bus:

1) GND
2) CNT2  (CIA2 serial clock)  -> userport pin 6
3) SP2   (CIA2 serial data)   -> userport pin 7
4) PB7   (CIA2 port B bit 7)  -> userport pin L (BUSY line, active-low)

Node IDs are configured locally on each plug via two input bits:

- PB0 (userport pin C) = ID bit 0
- PB1 (userport pin D) = ID bit 1

Two bits allow 4 IDs (ID#1..ID#4). The plug labels match the software’s internal numbering.

Physical order on the cable (it is important!! that ID#2 is at the end of the cable):
- ID#1, ID#4, ID#3, ID#2

Cable length was approximately 3 metres. The cable was physically daisy-chained (two or four plugs on one cable) but electrically a single bus (each signal conductor continuous across all plugs). When you use only two plugs we tested cable length up to 20m with no problems, but when you have open unused plugs in the middle of the cable, you better only use 3m of cable.

## PB7 BUSY / arbitration behaviour

From the client and master binaries (“transm 2.75” and “sd2.75”), PB7 is used with this polarity:

- PB7 HIGH = bus free / released
- PB7 LOW  = bus busy / claimed

Typical sequence observed in both programs:
- Wait until PB7 reads HIGH
- Switch PB6/PB7 direction to output (DDRB = $C0)
- Force PB6/PB7 low (mask PRB with $3F and write back)
- Perform serial transfer steps
- Release bus again by switching DDRB back to input (DDRB = $00)

This is consistent with an open-bus style arbitration line:
participants only drive PB7 low when claiming the bus.

## Bias / termination (as remembered)

- PB7 had a pull-up to +5 V at ID#1 (master end), typically 4.7 kΩ.
- ID#1 also had an activity LED that indicates bus usage (LED on when PB7 is pulled low).
- SP2 and CNT2 were left without explicit external pull-ups (bus relied on device behaviour / internal characteristics).

Note: When reproducing, it might be prudent to provide optional pull-ups for SP2/CNT2 (e.g. 10 kΩ to +5 V at one end) as a stability option.

## ID strapping (PB0/PB1): physical wiring vs software numbering

There are two separate concepts:

1) Physical strap wiring (what you solder):
- Strap PB0 and PB1 via resistors either to GND or to +5 V (local +5 V on that machine).
- Recommended safe resistor value: 4.7 kΩ.

2) Software numbering / plug labels:
- The software reads PB0/PB1 and maps the 2-bit value to the internal node numbering. The plugs were labelled ID#1..ID#4 and this mapping matches the software.

Mapping to plug labels (ID#1..ID#4):

- ID#1: PB1 -> GND, PB0 -> GND
- ID#2: PB1 -> GND, PB0 -> +5 V
- ID#3: PB1 -> +5 V, PB0 -> GND
- ID#4: PB1 -> +5 V, PB0 -> +5 V

## Software components

Bootstrap:
- “transm 2.75” is the receiver/client program for nodes ID#2..ID#4.
- “sd2.75” is the host/distributor program for node ID#1.

Both programs use CIA2 registers ($DDxx), including:
- $DD01 (PRB) for PB7 busy and PB0/PB1 ID read
- $DD03 (DDRB) to switch PB6/PB7 between input and output
- $DD0C (SDR) for serial byte transfer
- $DD04/$DD05 (Timer A) and $DD0E (CRA) to drive timing / serial mode
- $DD0D (ICR) to poll/ack serial shift completion

## Boot / distribution sequence (operational description)

1) Clients (ID#2..ID#4) start in receive mode (software: “transm 2.75”), allowing the initial host (ID#1) to detect present nodes via a handshake/ACK scheme.
2) ID#1 distributes the required software payload over the network (and can also send a command to start it):
   - character set
   - machine code routines
   - map data
   - BASIC program variant (human or computer player)
3) After distribution, clients start the distributed BASIC program
4) During play, each node has all required local data; only deltas/updates are exchanged.
   Updates may be broadcast to all nodes or sent to a single affected node.

## Open items / unknowns

- Whether additional pull-ups on SP2/CNT2 were present in the original plugs (not required by the binaries alone).

## Addendum (Jan 2026): arbitration timing + optional PB6 LED

*This is based on disassembly of `sd2.75` (host, load $9A00, 1391 bytes).*

### PB6 (optional “THIS C64 uses the bus” LED)
When a node claims the bus it drives **both PB7 and PB6 LOW** by setting DDRB=$C0 and writing PRB&=$3F.
This makes PB6 suitable for an **optional per-node activity LED** inside each plug (local indicator: “this C64 is currently claiming/using the bus”).
PB7 can still be used for a “bus busy at all” LED (typically on the master plug).

(If you implement the PB6 LED: use a low-current LED and a series resistor to +5 V (e.g. 1.5 kΩ), similar to the PB7 LED concept. PB6 is not part of the 4-wire bus; it is local to the plug.)

### How simultaneous sends are avoided in practice (BUSY + ID delay + NMI receive)
Claim/release (CIA2):

If a C64 want to send data over the bus:
- Wait until **PB7 reads HIGH** (bus free), then claim:
  `DDRB = $C0` (PB6/PB7 outputs) and `PRB = PRB & $3F` (drives PB6+PB7 LOW).
- Release:
  `DDRB = $00` (PB6/PB7 back to input / high-Z).

After claiming PB7 LOW, the code waits an **ID-scaled delay** before switching the serial hardware into transmit mode.
This delay is implemented as a fixed loop repeated `ID` times and, on PAL, is approximately:

- ID 1: 261 cycles ≈ 0.265 ms
- ID 2: 517 cycles ≈ 0.525 ms
- ID 3: 773 cycles ≈ 0.785 ms
- ID 4: 1029 cycles ≈ 1.045 ms
(Assuming PAL φ2 ≈ 985,248 Hz.)

Serial speed reference (Timer A = $0007, as used by NET’97):
- ≈ 7,697 bytes/s on PAL → **~0.130 ms per byte** (1 byte time)

Receive path and why it matters:
- Incoming serial traffic triggers a **CIA2 NMI** (custom NMI handler installed at $0318/$0319).
- On CIA2 NMI, the handler reads the first byte from SDR and then **pulls the rest of the packet synchronously** by polling the CIA2 “shift complete” flag and reading SDR.
- After the NMI handler returns, execution resumes where it was interrupted (typically still in the post-claim ID delay loop).

Practical arbitration effect:
- Even if two machines were to pull PB7 LOW very close together, **the lower ID reaches “start transmit” earlier** because its post-claim delay is shorter.
- While higher IDs are still in their delay window, the first transmitted byte arrives quickly (~0.130 ms/byte at TimerA=$07) and can trigger CIA2 NMI, forcing them to receive the packet before they ever switch into transmit.
- PB7 remains LOW while they are interrupted/receiving (they already claimed it), so the bus stays in a consistent “busy” state during that period.

Net result: the combination of (1) claiming PB7, (2) an ID-based post-claim delay longer than a byte time, and (3) NMI-driven reception that pulls complete packets, strongly suppresses practical overlaps and gives lower IDs priority.
